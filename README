BUILD:

First clone the repo (git clone...)
After this open the repo folder in android studio. Android studio recognizes the git repo as a android studio project.
After this press the "run" button in android studio (green play symbol) and configure your emulator device if you havent already done so.
(Project has been tested with a nexus 5X with oreo 26).
After this the app should open automatically in the emulator, but if it doesn't, the app can be found in the applications menu.

USAGE:
In the first screen you can press the hall button to activate it, and it stays in "on" position as long as you keep the image pressed.
Swiping the screen to the right gets you to the screen where you can connect to the server. Pressing the bar at the top of the application
screen connects / disconnects you to/from the server. In the upper right corner you can press the three dots to open a menu where you can go
to the application settings. In "general" you can configure your server address (for example "hölökynkölökyn.vappu.fi") and the frequency on which
the application works on (for example 1337).
